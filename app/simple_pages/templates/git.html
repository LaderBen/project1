            <h2>Branches</h2>
            <p class="h5 mvRight">
                Branch in Git is similar to the branch of a tree. Analogically, a tree branch is attached to the central
                part of the tree called the trunk. While branches can generate and fall off, the trunk remains compact
                and is the only part by which we can say the tree is alive and standing. Similarly, a branch in Git is a
                way to keep developing and coding a new feature or modification to the software and still not affecting
                the main part of the project. We can also say that branches create another line of development in the
                project. The primary or default branch in Git is the master branch (similar to a trunk of the tree). As
                soon as the repository creates, so does the main branch (or the default branch).
            </p>
            <p class="h5 mvRight">
                Branch in Git is "lightweight". Light in terms of the data they carry and the little mess they create.
                In
                other version control systems such as SVN, creating branches is a cumbersome process. Moreover, once the
                branch creates, the whole main code from the main branch gets copied to the newly created branch.
                Whereas, in Git, the code is separated only from the point of creation of the branch. Once the creation
                of the new branch happens, we can switch to this branch and start development.

            <h2>Merge</h2>
            <p class="h5 mvRight">
                Merging is a common practice for developers using version control systems. Whether branches are created
                for testing, bug fixes, or other reasons, merging commits changes to another location. To be more
                specific, merging takes the contents of a source branch and integrates them with a target branch. In
                this process, only the target branch is changed. The source branch history remains the same.
            </p>
            <h2>Commit</h2>
            <p class="h5 mvRight">
                The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository.
            </p>
            <h2>Tags</h2>
            <p class="h5 mvRight">
                Tags are ref's that point to specific points in Git history. Tagging is generally used to capture a
                point
                in history that is used for a marked version release (i.e. v1.0.1). A tag is like a branch that doesnâ€™t
                change. Unlike branches, tags, after being created, have no further history of commits
            </p>
            <h2>Repositories</h2>
            <p class="h5 mvRight">
                Repositories in GIT contain a collection of files of various different versions of a Project. These
                files are imported from the repository into the local server of the user for further updations and
                modifications in the content of the file.
            </p>
